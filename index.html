          <h2>Assignment 1</h2>
          <p>We are not alone in this chaotic and disturbing year of the pandemic, we are all united to face and overcome the emotions of fear and insecurity. I modelled the text with Spline and then I edited the 3D lettering with Photomosh, to overlay it over a picture of a handshake in the background. The handshake was chosen as a sign of solidarity, showing my determination to overcome difficulties caused by the pandemic, but thriving together with my family.</p>
          <p>This one illustrates my anxiety and restlessness at the beginning of the pandemic. I used barrel blur and solarize effects on Photomosh to express my emotion my design. The golden mask added a more sophisticated element to the imagery mood.</p>

            <p>For the assignment 2, I had to build 21 iterations using a JS framework called P5.</p>
            <p>It wasn't easy since I don't have any experience with programming, so to catch up with everything by watching the programming videos on Youtube, and also reading the documentation, it felt a bit overwhelming to me.</p>
            <p>Although it wasn't an easy process, I was able to make some code watching the tutorials and also exploring a few websites where I could have access to step-by-step learning.</p>
            <p>This helped me to create a few animations and, also, some mouse interactions that would trigger the animations. It's a broad new field to invest your time, but if you're willing to add code to your graphic design skills, P5 is a good start.</p>

        <h2>Assignment 3 - The Me of the Screen (Auto-Ethnography Of A Digital Interaction)</h2>
      </div>
      <p>For assignment 3, I interacted with at least 10 different digital interfaces over 5 days, taking notes and answering questions in the process such as: "how often do you used this interaction" or "how long?" I also had to cover the quatliattive data to have a better understanding fo my experience and to be able to identify the issues on those interactions. The biggest issue I noticed was the WeChat distraction aspect, which interferes very heavily in my life and makes my daily routines be harder to be accomplished. The final result was an infographic combining static elements and animated assets, with the whole animation made possible by the use of the After Effects software.</p>
      <p>I hope you enjo the outcomes of my work.</p>

        <h3>Reading Discussion 1: Tool Standards and Poetics</h3>
          <p><strong>Reading 1:</strong> <a href="http://www.eyemagazine.com/feature/article/the-programmed-designer" target="_blank">http://www.eyemagazine.com/feature/article/the-programmed-designer</a></p>
          <p><strong>Reading 2:</strong> <a href="https://www.are.na/blog/the-internet's-back-to-the-land-movement" target="_blank">https://www.are.na/blog/the-internet's-back-to-the-land-movement</a></p>

        <strong> Now take a moment to write a written response to each of the questions below:</strong>

        <p><strong>1.The two articles both articulate an ethical problem related to their topic (industry-standard design tools & the current scale and state of the internet). Define what you consider to be the author's positions in relation to these two topics and how they overlap. Do they suggest solutions? If so, how do those solutions relate to the other article?</strong></p>
        <p><strong>R.</strong>Both articles, " the programmed designer" and The Internet's "Back-to-the-Land Movement" talked about the impact of computer networks on industry standards and people's lives. The solution is one that proposes to develop more diverse and autonomous work practices to involve everyone. The other article proposes to stay within the constraints of the existing structure, or off the grid. Both articles mention building your own structural system.</p>
        <p><strong>2. How do you see the impending resource scarcity discussed in Abbe’s article having an effect on yourself as a designer?</strong></p>
        <p><strong>R.</strong>The environmental issues discussed in Abbe's article made me see that human beings should continue to explore and find alternative resources to solve the problem of resource scarcity. It also raised my responsibility as a designer in the way I approach problems. Although the digital network has its resource limitations, the designer builds according to the concept of cycle preservation in the design process, which is more suitable for social development. We need to be careful in how we deliver ideas because the impact of those ideas and how we use the resources around us are points that good designers need to consider.</p>

        <h3>Reading Discussion 2: Code, letters, logic, play.</h3>
        <p><strong>Watch:</strong> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5ATijqPdXQ" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5ATijqPdXQ</a></p>
        <p><strong>Read:</strong> <a href="https://www.typotheque.com/articles/the_importance_of_play" target="_blank">https://www.typotheque.com/articles/the_importance_of_play</a></p>
        <p><strong>Many of the tools and languages mentioned by Just van Rossum in the talk are open-source in nature. Find 3 other unique languages/software/tools that are open source. Describe how you could apply open source principles to your design process.</strong></p>
        <p>There are many enhanced free open source tools and software available for graphic designers, and many designers now prefer to use open-source software because this software can be easily used for free by users.</p>
        <p>These are the 3 best open source software that I love:</p>
        <p>1. <a href="https://www.blender.org/" target="_blank">Blender</a></p>
        <p>Blender is a free and open-source, 3D creation suite that makes it possible for graphic designers to create animated films, visual effects, art, 3D printed models, virtual reality, and computer games.</p>
        <p>It also provides support for 2D animation and is a powerful tool.</p>
        <p>2. <a href="https://www.figma.com/" target="_blank">Figma</a></p>
        <p>Figma is a vector graphics editor and prototyping tool that is primarily web-based with additional offline functionality enabled by the application. Allows viewing and interacting with Figma prototypes in real-time on mobile devices. Its best feature is the online collaboration tool that allows designers and developers to edit, comment, and review designs and code together. Everyone works towards a common goal to complete the blueprint.</p>
        <p>3. <a href="https://glyphsapp.com/" target="_blank">Glyphs</a>
        <p>This is a very handy type of design software for typography, architecture, and archaeology.</p>
        <p>In typography, simplicity and convenience are used and favored by many font designers.</p>
        <p>Open-source software provides viewers with the opportunity to access the source code and make changes to it. This allows more ideas to be concentrated in it. Creativity is the most important part of the design process, which makes practical open-source software more and more popular.</p>

        <h3>Reading Discussion 3: Olia Lialina — Turing Complete User & Laurel Schwulst — My website is a shifting house next to a river of knowledge...</h3>
        <p><strong>Read:</strong> <a href="http://contemporary-home-computing.org/turing-complete-user/" target="_blank">http://contemporary-home-computing.org/turing-complete-user/</a></p>
        <strong>What do you think of Lialina’s definition of the universal user? Do you think it is a useful category for understanding Schwulst’s argument advocating for individual websites over platforms? Explain why and provide at least 1 example.</strong></p>
        <p>Lialina’s definition of the universal user means liaising with hardware and software. This interaction makes the user-visible in a user engagement, and if you want to think about it in terms of interface design and user experience, it is the ultimate user experience. And how to provide such a user experience, the software industry needs to produce software tailored to the user's needs, which can be imperfect, and generic users use the experience process to perfect it. Focus on ambiguity and user involvement. I like Lialina's definition of "universal user" and think it's a good interpretation. Don Norman said: "We design for people, we don't design for users".Schwulst's definition is one I agree with. A website is an interconnected network of individual nodes that breathe life into a vast network. The web is really working for people. A website is a natural connection that helps you find and achieve your needs. Instead, they are powered by a small group of large companies - such as Facebook/Instagram, Twitter, and Google.</p>
        <p>I consider myself an "invisible user". And I'll go through the comments and feedback to find the products I want. As a design learner, I tend to use the site as nature, looking for technical sources and supplementing my creativity. I see it as a tool that ultimately requires your own judgment and choice. Schwulst said “The web is a flock of birds or a sea of punctuation marks, each tending or forgetting about their web garden or puddle home with a river of knowledge nearby.“ As design learners, we can think broadly about the content of the website and create our own space, ultimately a website is a personal act of the larger environment.</p>

        <h3>Reading Discussion 4: In Free Fall, Hito Steyerl</h3>
        <p><strong>Read:</strong> <a href="https://www.e-flux.com/journal/24/67860/in-free-fall-a-thought-experiment-on-vertical-perspective/" target="_blank">https://www.e-flux.com/journal/24/67860/in-free-fall-a-thought-experiment-on-vertical-perspective/</a></p>
        <strong>A major theme that runs throughout Steyerl’s essay is that of surveillance. In your own words, define surveillance and discuss how the notion of a “vertical” or aerial perspective lends itself to a culture of surveillance according to Steyerl’s thought experiment.</strong></p>
        <p>Surveillance is the collection of information to achieve a specific purpose. And surveillance of the target. During the covid-19 pandemic, some national government agencies also used surveillance videos and smartphone location data to help track and establish the chain of virus transmission. The rapid spread of the pandemic prompted governments to enact a series of digital surveillance measures in the name of self-interest, which also weakened people's ability to keep their health private.</p>
        <p>As Steyerl's article, as science and technology continue to evolve, humans have begun to look at the world from different perspectives, like SpaceX's satellite communications service, Starlink, which uses thousands of satellites to create vertical or aerial views of images or photos for military communications reconnaissance, missile defense, remotely piloted drones, and precision positioning. It also enables tactical data transfer and intelligence sharing. In the new type of warfare, you can remotely over-control the battle, which reduces the number of casualties. Like SpaceX, from numerous failures to the final success, it all shows the strong will of humanity to conquer outer space, and this determination to explore what lies beyond the sky has inspired the invention of many state-of-the-art technologies.</p>
