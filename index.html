<p>My name is Yanxia. I love Graphic Design.</p>
<p>We are not alone in this chaotic and disturbing year of the pandemic, we are
  all united to face and overcome the emotions of fear and insecurity. I modelled
  the text with Spline and then I edited the 3D lettering with Photomosh, to
  overlay it over a picture of a handshake in the background. The handshake was
  chosen as a sign of solidarity, showing my determination to overcome difficulties
   caused by the pandemic, but thriving together with my family.</p>
<p>This one illustrates my anxiety and restlessness at the beginning of the pandemic.
   I used barrel blur and solarize effects on Photomosh to express my emotion through
   my design. The golden mask added a more sophisticated element to the imagery mood.</p>
